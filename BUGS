Known bugs in bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
==============================================

I know of the following bugs in bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free;
there is no need to report them if you come across them, but fixes are
welcome.

General
=======

Some games may not handle signals (especially resizing) properly.
Handling signals properly means in a way conforming to ISO C and
POSIX.1: no async-unsafe functions may be used in a signal handler if
the signal could have interrupted an async-unsafe function, and any
variable of static storage duration assigned to must be of type
volatile sig_atomic_t.  (See adventure for an example of proper
handling.)

Some games may not check for errors when they should (including
allocation failure), or may return inappropriate exit statuses.

Some games may have arbitrary limits that they should not have.

Specific games
==============

Under some circumstances, hunt fails to start the hunt daemon if one
is not already running.  In general, hunt needs thorough testing by
someone willing to investigate and fix bugs; at present hunt should be
considered unsupported and probably broken.

Saving in monop is completely broken.  Since it assumes it can save by
writing out the whole data space from 0 to sbrk(0) and read it in to
restore, it may not be easy to fix.

Gomoku can use 16 megabytes or more of memory.  (This is reported (not
by me) as NetBSD PR 3126.)
