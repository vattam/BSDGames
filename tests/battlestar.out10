Version 4.2, fall 1984.
First Adventure game written by His Lordship, the honorable
Admiral D.W. Riggle


	This is a luxurious stateroom.
The floor is carpeted with a soft animal fur and the great wooden furniture
is inlaid with strips of platinum and gold.  Electronic equipment built
into the walls and ceiling is flashing wildly.  The floor shudders and
the sounds of dull explosions rumble though the room.  From a window in
the wall ahead comes a view of darkest space.  There is a small adjoining
room behind you, and a doorway right.

>-: 
	These are the executive suites of the battlestar.
Luxurious staterooms carpeted with crushed velvet and adorned with beaten
gold open onto this parlor. A wide staircase with ivory banisters leads
up or down. This parlor leads into a hallway left. The bridal suite is
right. Other rooms lie ahead and behind you.

>-: 
	You are in what was once an elegant stateroom.
Whoever lived in this stateroom, he and his female companion
were mercilessly slain in their sleep. Clothes, trinkets and personal
belongings are scattered all across the floor. Through a hole in the
collapsed floor I can see a hallway below.  A door is behind you.

There is a strange golden amulet on the floor here.
>-: 
	The hallway is very congested with rubble here.
It is too choked with broken steel girders and other debris to continue
on much farther. Above, the ceiling has caved in and it is possible to 
climb up. There is not much chance to go back, ahead, or left.
But the hallway seems clearer right.

There are a few coins here.
>-: 
	You are in a wide hallway leading to the main hangar.
The walls and ceiling here have been blasted through in several places.
It looks as if quite a battle has been fought for possession of the landing bay
Gaping corpses litter the floor.  The hallway continues behind you.
The main hangar is ahead.

>-: 
	You are in the main hangar.
This is a huge bay where many fighters and cargo craft lie.  Alarms are 
sounding and fighter pilots are running to their ships.  Above is a gallery
overlooking the bay. The scream of turbo engines is coming from right. The rest
of the hangar is left. There is an exit behind you.

>-: 
	This is the launch room.
From the launch tubes here fighters blast off into space. Only one is left,
and it is guarded by two fierce men. A staircase leads up from here.
There is a cluttered workbench ahead. From the main hangar come sounds of great
explosions.  The main hangar is behind you. The viper launch tubes are right.

>-: 
	You are in the viper launch tube.
The two guards are eyeing you warily! 

There is a Viper ready for launch here.
>-: You climb into the viper and prepare for launch.
With a touch of your thumb the turbo engines ignite, thrusting you back into
your seat.

	You are in space.
