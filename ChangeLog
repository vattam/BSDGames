1998-09-24  Joseph Samuel Myers  <jsm@octomino.demon.co.uk>

	* Version 2.5.

	* bsd-games.lsm, bsd-games-non-free.lsm: Update.

	* Paul Janzen has checked with the original author, and it turns
	out the the BSD licence applies to boggle and obsoletes the old
	one, so boggle can go in the main bsd-games package.
	* boggle/README: Update accordingly.
	* boggle/README.linux, boggle/Makefrag: Update accordingly.  No
	longer need to include uuencoded patch.
	* boggle/boggle/helpfile: Update accordingly.
	* INSTALL: Update accordingly.
	* NEWS: Update accordingly.
	* PACKAGING: Update accordingly.

1998-09-23  Joseph Samuel Myers  <jsm@octomino.demon.co.uk>

	* NEWS: Update.

	* trek/main.c: Make Mother uid_t.

	* hunt/hunt/hunt.c: Don't declare errno.

	* hunt/huntd/hunt.h: Don't declare errno - include <errno.h>
	instead.

	* factor/Makefrag: Define _GNU_SOURCE, for isblank().
	* number/Makefrag, primes/Makefrag: Likewise.

	* With glibc 2.1, various headers can be included with an
	__need_foo preprocessor define to make them only define some
	particular symbols; this interacts badly with multiple inclusion
	protection on the header wrappers in bsd-games.  Therefore, we
	must not protect wrapper headers against multiple inclusion, but
	instead make sure they are safe to be included multiple times and
	only protect local bits that need it.
	* include/signal.h: Don't protect against multiple inclusion -
	only protect the sig_t definition that needs it.
	* include/stdlib.h: Don't protect against multiple inclusion.
	* include/stdio.h: Don't protect against multiple inclusion.
	* include/termios.h: Don't protect against multiple inclusion.
	* include/sys/cdefs.h: Don't protect against multiple inclusion.
	* include/sys/ttydefaults.h: Don't protect against multiple
	inclusion.

	* dm/dm.c: Don't include <nlist.h> - it isn't needed, and doesn't
	exist with some glibc versions.

	* INSTALL: Minor changes.
